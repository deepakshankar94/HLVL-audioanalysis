1. audio data is extracted using ffmpeg and converted to wav and mp4. mp3 is not used as before to prevent loss due to compression 

2. The following data will be extracted from  :

Energy
Spectral 
Linear Predictive Coding (LPC)
Perceptual Linear Prediction Cepstral Coefficients (PLPCC)
Chroma feature vector (vector of pitch classes)
chroma deviations 
d-vector


3. VGGish model was taken from the pretrained samples

4. hop length was modified for bggish input so that the last 0.04 seconds of audio are chopped as model expects 0.96 second input

5. embeddings are populated using this mehod for the data

6. data is cleaned to have a time frame of 1 second for an embedding

7. tried pca with SVM and knn no improvement (actually lower of close to .56)

8. continuing gestures are not detected (sustain and fading of the voice with gesture)


TODO sutain and fade of voice

analyze failures of the svm cases
analyze the intuition for the features
try the dimensionality reduction with PCA and train using those

#PCA doesn't seem to improve the value of the accuracy so our innitial 20 features perform much better

TODO 7/11/18

Find original sounds that are like gesture speech are lighting up the same features and understand them
find interesting audio in question windows in the videos
try to annotate other videoes and try to see the result

#we can see that there is more voice modulation in the places where we can detect a gesture high versus low frequency
#

TODO 14/11/18

Try find the difference in the score between the gestures that we can detect and gestures that we can't detect and see if it affects the scores 
onesided pared t tests done but might not be conclusive


ALso do lit survey to understand if there is a relation between modualtion and attention and gesture
Voice should be modulated

more study on content than on voice . if there is then no backing as such


See speech vs gesture under different gesture types (bicycle and perspective)


28/11/18
- talk about the test partition quality (p values of 1,2,5 and 3,4,6)
- retrain the data into different gestures and see how that performs
